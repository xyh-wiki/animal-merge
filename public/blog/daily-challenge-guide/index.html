# Daily Challenge Guide – Make the Most of Today’s Board

Animal Merge Evolution includes a Daily Challenge mode that gives you a fresh board every day and a dedicated daily leaderboard.

## How Daily Challenge Works

- Each day has a unique **starting layout** and **random seed**.
- All players share the same conditions on that day.
- Your best finished run is recorded in the **daily leaderboard**.

## Why Play Daily Mode?

- Short sessions with a clear goal.
- Fair comparison with other players on the same board.
- Great for warming up and testing new strategies.

## Tips for Better Daily Scores

1. **Play Two or Three Warm-Up Runs**
Use early runs to understand the “shape“ of the board and how it tends to fill.

2. **Adapt, Don’t Force Your Classic Strategy**
Some daily boards favor vertical merges, others horizontal. Adjust your main corner if needed.

3. **Use Undo Only When Necessary**
Undo is still limited in Daily. Save it for moves that:
- Destroy your main stacking pattern
- Accidentally fill the board with low-level animals

4. **Know When to Reset**
If you make a very early mistake that ruins your corner, it may be faster to restart.

## How Scores Are Ranked

- Higher **score** is better.
- If two scores are equal, fewer **moves** is better.
- The highest **animal level** is also displayed as a quick way to see strong runs.

Come back every day for a new Daily Challenge and climb the leaderboard.
