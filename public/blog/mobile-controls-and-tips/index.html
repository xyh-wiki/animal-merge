# Mobile Controls and Tips for Animal Merge Evolution

Animal Merge Evolution works great on phones and tablets. Here are some tips to make your mobile experience smoother.

## Basic Mobile Controls

- Swipe on the board to move all animals:
- Swipe up → move up
- Swipe down → move down
- Swipe left → move left
- Swipe right → move right
- The page is configured to **not scroll** while you are swiping on the board.

## Turn Off Unnecessary System Gestures

On some devices:

- System gestures (home bar, back swipe) can interfere with horizontal swipes.
- Consider enabling **“gesture protection“** or playing in landscape mode if available.

## Play in Short Sessions

- Daily Challenge is perfect for quick mobile sessions.
- Classic mode can also be played in short bursts; the game doesn’t require long continuous focus.

## Battery and Data Usage

- The game is **light-weight** and runs fully in the browser.
- There is no heavy download; graphics are mostly emojis and simple layouts.

With good swiping habits and a stable internet connection, mobile play can be just as strong as desktop play.
