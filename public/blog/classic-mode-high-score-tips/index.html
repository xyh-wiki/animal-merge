# Classic Mode High-Score Tips

Classic mode is the core experience of Animal Merge Evolution. There is no time limit, so every move matters.

## Build a Stable Board First

- Don’t rush to create high-level animals in the very first moves.
- First, build a stable corner with mid-level animals.
- Then slowly upgrade that corner into high-level animals.

## Avoid “Random Swiping”

- Swiping quickly in random directions usually fills the board with low-level animals.
- Think before each move: what will this do to my main corner?

## Keep an Escape Route

- Always leave at least one **row or column** that can be cleared easily.
- This prevents sudden dead-ends where the board fills up.

## Use Themes and Visual Cues

- Pick the theme that makes it easiest for you to read the board.
- If high-level animals have glow effects, use that as a quick visual reference.

## Take Breaks

- If you feel stuck or tilted, pause for a few minutes.
- Fresh eyes make better decisions and higher scores.
