# How to Reach Dragon Fast in Animal Merge Evolution

Reaching the Dragon level is one of the main milestones in Animal Merge Evolution. This guide focuses on practical strategies to get there faster and more consistently.

## 1. Pick a “Main Corner”

Choose one corner of the board (for example, top-left) and try to keep your **highest-level animals** there.

- Always push in directions that **do not break the corner**.
- Avoid random moves that scatter your highest animals across the board.

## 2. Keep Lower-Level Animals Away From the Corner

- Use side moves to push small animals (like Mouse and Cat) to the opposite side.
- This creates a “level gradient” from your corner (high) to the other side (low).
- When merges happen, high-level animals will naturally stack near your corner.

## 3. Think Two Moves Ahead

Before you swipe, ask:

- Will this move create new merges?
- Will this move block my main corner?
- Will this move open space for future merges?

If a move fills the board without strong merges, it is usually a bad move.

## 4. Use Undo Wisely

Undo is limited, so use it for:

- Recovering from a bad move that **breaks the corner**.
- Fixing mistakes where a swipe didn’t go in the direction you intended.
- Trying two different sequences and keeping the better one.

## 5. Don’t Rush the Endgame

When the board is mostly high-level animals:

- Avoid making the board completely full.
- Try to clear small clusters before going for big merges.
- Sometimes, skipping a short-term merge can produce a bigger chain later.

With practice, reaching Dragon will feel natural. You can then push even further toward the final evolution.
