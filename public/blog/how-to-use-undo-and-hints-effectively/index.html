# How to Use Undo and Hints Effectively in Animal Merge Evolution

Undo and hint are powerful tools in Animal Merge Evolution, but they are limited. Using them wisely can dramatically improve your scores.

## Understanding Undo

- Undo lets you **revert the last move**.
- You have a limited number of undo actions per game.
- Undo restores the board, score, and move count to the previous state.

### When to Use Undo

- When a swipe breaks your stacking pattern or corner.
- When a swipe unexpectedly fills the board and creates a near-death situation.
- When you mis-swipe on mobile (for example, diagonal instead of pure horizontal).

### When Not to Use Undo

- On every small mistake – you will run out quickly.
- To chase a single merge that doesn’t change the board significantly.

## Understanding Hints

- Hint suggests a **recommended direction** (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- It is based on a local evaluation of merges and board space.
- Like Undo, hints are limited.

### Best Ways to Use Hints

- When you have multiple possible merges and are not sure which one is better.
- In late game, when the board is crowded and a wrong move can end the run.
- To learn patterns as a beginner. Watch **why** the suggested direction is good.

## Combining Undo and Hint

A strong pattern is:

1. Use **Hint** to pick a direction.
2. If the result is worse than expected, immediately **Undo**.
3. Try your own alternative move.

This lets you compare strategies without throwing away a run.
