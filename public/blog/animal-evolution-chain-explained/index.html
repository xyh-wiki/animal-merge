# Animal Evolution Chain Explained

One of the most satisfying parts of Animal Merge Evolution is watching animals evolve into stronger and rarer forms.

## From Mouse to Dragon

While the exact chain may change in future updates, the idea is:

- Start with basic animals like **Mouse** and **Cat**
- Merge your way up through medium levels (Rabbit, Fox, etc.)
- Reach high-level animals such as **Panda**, **Tiger**, and finally **Dragon**

Each step in the chain has:

- An emoji
- A name
- An internal value used for scoring and highlighting

## Why Evolution Matters

- Higher-level animals **unlock more score per merge**.
- When you reach certain milestones, the game may show special visual effects.
- Reaching Dragon or beyond is often used as a personal high-score goal.

## Reading the Evolution Panel

On the right side of the game, you can see:

- A visual chain of animals connected with arrows.
- Each emoji and name shows where it sits in the evolution.

Use this panel to plan ahead and decide which merges are most valuable.
