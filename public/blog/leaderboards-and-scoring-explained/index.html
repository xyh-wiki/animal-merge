# Leaderboards and Scoring in Animal Merge Evolution

This article explains how scoring works and how the leaderboards decide your ranking.

## How Score Is Calculated

While the internal formula can change, the basic idea is:

- Each merge gives you points based on the **level** of the resulting animal.
- Higher-level merges are worth significantly more points.
- Long chains of merges in a single move are usually very powerful.

## What the Leaderboards Show

There are two main leaderboards:

1. **Classic – All time**
- Shows your best runs in Classic mode.
- Sorted by score, then by moves.
2. **Daily challenge – Today**
- Shows runs played in Daily mode **for today’s date**.

Each entry usually includes:

- Rank (#1, #2, #3…)
- Score
- Highest animal name and emoji
- Number of moves used

## How to Save a Run

- Finish your game or reach a point where you are satisfied.
- Click **“New Game”**.
- The game will automatically save your current run into the appropriate leaderboard.

## Improving Your Ranking

- Focus on **playing cleanly**, not just quickly.
- Avoid wasting moves that don’t create merges.
- In Daily mode, try again later in the day if you discover a better strategy.
