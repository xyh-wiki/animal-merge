# How to Play Animal Merge Evolution – Beginner’s Guide

Animal Merge Evolution is a relaxing browser puzzle game where you swipe to move cute animals and merge them into higher evolution levels. This guide walks you through the basic rules, controls, and simple strategies.

## Basic Rules

- All animals on the board move in the direction you choose (up, down, left, or right).
- When two animals of the same level collide, they merge into the next evolution.
- Each merge gives you score and brings you closer to the final animal (Dragon and beyond).
- The game is over when there are no valid moves left on the board.

## Controls on Desktop

- Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to move animals.
- You don’t need to click the board first – global keyboard control is enabled.
- You can also use **W/A/S/D** if your browser captures them as arrow keys.

## Controls on Mobile

- Swipe **up, down, left, right** directly on the board.
- The page will not scroll while you are swiping.
- Short, clean swipes are easier for the game to detect.

## Game Modes

- **Classic Mode** – standard merge puzzle with no time limit.
- **Daily Mode** – a fresh challenge every day, with its own daily leaderboard.
- More modes may be added in the future, so check back regularly.

## What Counts as a Good Run?

- A run with **high score**, **few moves**, and a **high-level animal**.
- Finishing a game and starting a new one will save the result into the leaderboard.
